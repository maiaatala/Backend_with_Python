# Introduction

This Github repository showcases my progress in Learning backend development with Python, using SQLAlchemy and fast API. Every folder is a different project that was made with the objective of learning an specific tool, each one being more complex than its former iteration.

Folders 01 through 06 were coded between 26 of October of 2021 to 17 of December of 2021.

The next iteration, starting on february 3rd of 2022, will be to use PostgreSQL and implement a user login feature to a service app. ss
